# Pizza-Pi
A pizza ordering system allowing for customization, price calculation, and order submission built with Java and JavaFX

## About 
During my Introduction to Computer Science II at Queen's University for my final project, I decided to make a pizza ordering system after having ordered some Domino's the night before. This is an object oriented based program using both Java and JavaFX. 

## Technologies 
+ Java
+ JavaFX

## The Program 
So if you so happened to want to order a pizza without actually getting a pizza, then this is the program for you. Upon running main.java you will be greeted with a beautiful GUI for "Pizza-Pi". You will be given the two amazing options of A. Creating a new order or B. viewing the current order. By selecting "View Current Order" your previous order will be displayed to the screen, showing both the items within the order and the price of the overall order. Should you select "Create New Order" you will be send to a page in which you can make as many pizzas as you want. You will have the ability to select size, amount of cheese, and what toppings you wish to have on that pizza. Plus, don't worry, for all you "Vegetarian Ham Pizza" lovers out there, the program will not let you do this as it really does not make sense. After you are done ordering your 50 pizzas, you the final price will be displayed and you can finally submit your order. Once submitted a beautiful bar will appear showing your order progress and you will be given the option to go back to the main page to reexperience this exciting software.
